Title: "Comorbid Condition Value Set"
Description: """SNOMED and ICD-10-CM codes for common comorbid conditions. Aligns with Elixhauser comorbidity scale. ICD-10 codes are drawn from https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidityicd10/comformat_icd10cm_2019_1.txt. 

Conformance note: If an ICD-10-CM code is used, and an equivalent SNOMED CT code is available, the resulting instance will not validate against US Core Profiles."""
